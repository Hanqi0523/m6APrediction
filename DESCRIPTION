Description: Provides functions for predicting N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA 
  modification sites using a machine learning classifier. The package encodes 
  5-mer DNA sequences into positional nucleotide factors and integrates multiple 
  transcript-related features such as GC content, exon length, and RNA region. 
  It supports both batch and single-sample prediction modes, and includes 
  example datasets and pre-trained models for demonstration.
