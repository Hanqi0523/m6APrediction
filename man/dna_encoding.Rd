\title{Encode DNA strings to positional nucleotide factors}
\usage{
dna_encoding(dna_strings)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_strings}{Character vector. All elements must have the **same**
length and contain only A/T/C/G.}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` of factors with columns `nt_pos1 ... nt_posN` where
  `N = nchar(dna_strings[1])`. Each column has levels `c("A","T","C","G")`.
}
\description{
Convert equal-length DNA strings (A/T/C/G) into a data.frame where each
column is a nucleotide position (`nt_pos1`, `nt_pos2`, …) and each column is
a factor with levels `c("A","T","C","G")`.
}
\details{
This helper is used by downstream prediction functions to transform the
5-mer sequence into categorical predictors expected by the model.
}
\examples{
dna_encoding(c("ATCGA", "TTTTT"))
}
